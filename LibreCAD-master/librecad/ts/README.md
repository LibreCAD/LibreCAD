### LibreCAD Translation

LibreCAD supports more than 40 languages, nearly half of them have active contributors working on them.

Many languages have more than one contributor and most of them are not a developer. They are not familiar with source code and git.

For that and a couple of other reasons we have a translation server at http://translate.librecad.org/.
To reduce the workload for managing the server, the syncing process is automated by scripts. These scrips can be broken by manual commits to the *ts* folders because of merge conflicts which cannot be handled automatically.

So here is our urgent request: Even if you are an experienced developer, please register an account at http://translate.librecad.org/ and get some information from below, how to contribute in translating LibreCAD.

Find information in our Wiki:
