    <p>OOPS NO MANUAL!</p>
    <p>We are working to create a new manual specially for LibreCAD. The current version of our work-in-progress user manual is online at <a href="http://wiki.librecad.org/index.php/LibreCAD_users_Manual">LibreCAD User Manual</a>, which was originally created by Bob Woltz. Following Bob's initiative, many members of our user community have been helping to improve and update this user manual. Please share your knowledge and skills on LibreCAD at <a href="http://wiki.librecad.org/">LibreCAD wiki</a>.</p>
