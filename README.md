[LibreCAD](https://www.librecad.org) is a 2D CAD drawing tool
based on the community edition of [QCAD](https://www.qcad.org).
LibreCAD uses the cross-platform framework [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/),
which means it works with most operating systems.  
The user interface is translated in over 30 languages.  https://translate.librecad.org

The master branch represents the latest pre-release code,

The 2.1 branch will be the last to support Qt4.  
The 2.0 branch will be the last to support the QCAD toolbar. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LibreCAD/LibreCAD.svg?branch=2.0)](https://travis-ci.org/LibreCAD/LibreCAD)
