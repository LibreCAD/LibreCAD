[LibreCAD](http://www.librecad.org) is a 2D CAD drawing tool
based on the community edition of [QCAD](http://www.qcad.org).  
LibreCAD has been re-structured and ported to [Qt](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/) 4.  
It works on OS X, Windows and Linux.  

Most of the project is released under the GPLv2 license,  
but please read the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for additional information.

The master branch is used for the development of version 2.1.0,  
which will hopefully be released by the first solstice of 2016.  
- https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD/milestones/2.1.0
- http://forum.librecad.org/GUI-update-td5712246.html

The 2.0 branch represents the latest stable build (2.0.9) plus bug fixes.

[libdxfrw][1] is an associated project that allows LibreCAD to read DWG files.
