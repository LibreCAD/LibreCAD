/*
    This action class can snap (set) the relative-zero marker
    in the middle between two points chosen by the user.

    The middle point, by default, rests at a poistion 50% relative 
    to the position of the first point chosen, that is, 
    at the center of the imaginary line connecting the 
    two user-defined points.

    This percentage, however, can be modified by the user 
    in order to place the marker at a different position 
    along the imaginary line.
