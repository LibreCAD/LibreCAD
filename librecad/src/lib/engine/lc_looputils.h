/**
 * @brief The LoopExtractor class, to extract closed loops from edges.
 * The algorithmï¼š
 * 0. Move label all edges as unprocessed
 * 1. Find an edge closest to the bounding box of all edges;
 * 2. Set the start point of the edge as the target point;
 * 3. Label the edge as processed;
 * 4. Find internal point of the edge;
 * 5. From the end point of the current edge, find all unprocessed edges connected to this point;
 * 6. From the end point draw a small circle, find intersections between the circle and edges(the current, and connected);
 * 7. Find the direction angle from the circle center to the intersections. Add another angle from the end point to the
 * internal point from Step 4.;
 * 8. Sort the angles, find the direction right next to the direction of the current edge;
 * 9. Choose the edge which has an angle right next to the current edge's angle;
 * 10. Repeat steps 2- 19, until the target point set in Step 2 to find a closed loop;
 * 11. Repeat Steps 1-10, untill all edges are processed.
 *
 * The algorithm has the following assumptions:

 * 1. Contours are closed loops, so each edge has its start/end points connected to other edges;
 * 2. Each loop is simply closed with number of edges equals the number of vertices (Shared endpoints),
 * i.e. Euler characteristic 0;
 * 3. Full circles/ellipses are accepted as individual closed contours;
 * 4. No self-intersection among contours; i.e. no edge crosses another edge;
 * 5. Multiple edges are allowed to be connected at a single point;
 * 6. Closed contours may share edge endpoints, but no edge is shared by more than one contours.
