<a name="2"></a><h1>2 Preface</h1>

<a name="2_1"></a><h2>Scope of This Manual</h2>

<p>
This manual is designed to get you started using LibreCAD and to help you
  using it more efficiently. Further it will give you an idea of the more
  advanced possibilities behind LibreCAD. Chapter 3 will introduce you in the world
  of computer aided design (CAD). If you've already worked with a CAD program 
  before,
  you might want to skip this chapter.</p>
<a name="CAD"></a>
<a name="2_2"></a><h2>CAD - For the Uninitiated</h2>

<p>
If you take a look around you, most objects you will see once started
  off as a drawing in a CAD program. From your ball pen, your desk, furniture
  to your house and probably even your city - everything once had to be
  constructed either manually on paper or more likely with a CAD system.</p>
<a name="Computer-Aided Design"></a>
<p>
CAD stands for Computer-Aided Design. It's essential to realize that
  CAD applications differ from painting or drawing programs. Drawings made in
  CAD applications represent real-world objects in their exact original
  measures. The most important factors are accuracy and to show as many details
  as necessary to produce the object. If you're used to drawing programs, you
  will most likely find it inconvenient that there's usually no or only limited
  drag-and-drop functionality in CAD systems. This is part of the idea, that 
  everything is done accurately.
  The drawing doesn't only have to look accurate on the screen - it has to be
  accurate as a model. Moving an entity around means moving it from an exactly
  defined location to another exactly defined position. However, once you got
  used to this approach, you will never want to do technical drawings in an
  ordinary drawing program anymore.</p>
<a name="2_3"></a><h2>Is LibreCAD for me?</h2>

<a name="2D"></a>
<a name="3D"></a>
<p>
There are many different CAD systems out there and depending on what
  you intend to do, LibreCAD might or might not fit your bill. If you are looking 
  for a 3D
  modeling CAD application, you'll have to look somewhere else. LibreCAD is a 2D
  CAD program. That means that everything is projected onto a plane. This
  doesn't mean that it's only suitable to represent 2D objects though. A couple
  of 2D drawings which represent an object from different perspectives (e.g.
  from the side, the top and from the front) provide usually enough information
  to fully define the object and all its dimensions.</p>
<a name="Platforms"></a>
<p>
Some of the main reasons why you might want to use LibreCAD are its
  simplicity, the user friendly interface, its many features or simply the fact
  that it works on your favorite platform - be it Linux, an other Unix system,
  Windows or Mac OS X. Last but not least LibreCAD is part of the open source
  movement. This means that if you're a programmer you can add your own
  functionality.</p>
<p>
LibreCAD has an estimated user base of over 100'000 people worldwide. Its
  users range from industrial companies in the fields of mechanical and
  electronic engineering to private users, teachers and students. There are
  many other capable CAD systems out there and most of them offer much more
  than LibreCAD does. But most of them are bound to one single platform or 
  are simply not affordable for many potential users. That's where LibreCAD kicks
  in. LibreCAD targets the hobbyists,
  occasional CAD users and people who are not CAD professionals but still need
  to draw plans once in a while. LibreCAD is the CAD for the rest of us.</p>
<a name="2_4"></a><h2>Who Is Behind LibreCAD?</h2>

<p>
LibreCAD is a product of RibbonSoft, a software engineering company based
  in Switzerland. However, many other people have contributed to LibreCAD and it
  wouldn't be what it is today without the help of translators, developers and
  the feedback of LibreCAD users. Please refer also to the company homepage of
  RibbonSoft for more information: 
  <a href="http://www.ribbonsoft.com">www.ribbonsoft.com</a>

  .</p>
<a name="2_5"></a><h2>How can I get LibreCAD?</h2>

<p>
You can get the latest version of LibreCAD from 
  <a href="http://www.LibreCAD.org">www.LibreCAD.org</a>

  . On this web site you can also find more documentation and other resources
  for LibreCAD.</p>
<a name="2_6"></a><h2>LibreCAD and Qt</h2>

<a name="Qt"></a>
<a name="Trolltech"></a>
<p>
Qt is the cross platform C++ application framework that LibreCAD is based
  on. Much of the work involved in LibreCAD is done by Trolltech (
  <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">www.trolltech.com</a>

  ), the guys who develop Qt.</p>
