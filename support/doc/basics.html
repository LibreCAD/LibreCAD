<a name="3"></a><h1>3 Basic CAD Concepts</h1>

<p>
<i>This chapter is intended to introduce you into the basic concepts
  of a CAD system. If you're used to working with CAD system you might want to
  skip this chapter. Please note that the concepts mentioned in this chapter
  are all later described in detail.</i></p>
<a name="Entity"></a>
<a name="Graphic Object"></a>
<a name="3_1"></a><h2>Entities</h2>

<p>
Entities are graphical objects in a CAD system. Typical entities which
  are supported by most CAD systems are: points, lines and circular and
  elliptical arcs. More complex and CAD specific entities include polylines,
  texts, dimensioning, hatches and splines.</p>
<a name="Attribute"></a>
<a name="3_2"></a><h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>
Every entity has certain attributes such as its color, line type and
  line width.</p>
<a name="Layer"></a>
<a name="3_3"></a><h2>Layers</h2>

<p>
A basic concept of computer aided drafting is the use of layers to
  organize a drawing. Every entity of a drawing is on exactly one layer and a
  layer can contain lots of entities. Typically entities with a common
  'function' or common attributes are put on the same layer. E.g. you might
  want to put all axes in a drawing on a layer named 'axes' (see Figure
  1). Layers can have attributes (color, line width, line style).
  Each entity can have its own attributes or have its attributes defined by the
  layer it is placed on. In the latter case you can change for example the
  color of all 'axes' entities by changing the color of the layer
  'axes'.</p>
<p>
In manual drafting, a similar approach was used. Different building
  systems, such as wiring and air conditioning were often drawn on separate
  transparent sheet of paper. These sheets were then overlaid on one another to
  produce final drawings.</p>
<p class="figure">
<img border="0" src="imgs/layers01.png"></p><p class="figure_label">
<b>Figure 1:&nbsp;</b>Example use of
  layers.</p>
<a name="Block"></a>
<a name="Insert"></a>
<a name="Group of entities"></a>
<a name="3_4"></a><h2>Blocks</h2>

<p>
A Block is a group of entities. Blocks can be inserted into the same
  graphic more than once with different Attributes and different locations,
  scaling factors and rotation angles (see Figure 2). Such an
  instance of a block is usually called an Insert. Inserts have attributes just
  like entities and layers. An Entity that is part of an Insert can have its
  own attributes or share the attributes of the Insert. Once created, Inserts
  are still linked to the Block they instantiate. The power of inserts is, that
  you can modify the Block once and all Inserts will be updated
  accordingly.</p>

<b>Figure 2:&nbsp;</b>Three instances
  (Inserts) of a Block with different colors, angles and scalings.</p>
<a name="3_5"></a><h2>Drafting in CAD</h2>

<p>
In many ways, CAD is similar to traditional drafting. When drawing a
  plan or a view of an object on a paper, you would use tools such as a ruler
  to draw lines. In CAD systems there is a variety of tools available to
  achieve the same goal. The big advantage of a CAD system is the fact that you
  can change every entity of your drawing easily after you've created it. This
  might be the most difficult thing to learn when moving from paper to CAD.
  When working with a CAD system you will very often create lines that won't be
  on the final printout or which don't have the correct length and need to be
  trimmed later (see Figure 3). A common mistake of CAD beginners
  is wanting to create the final drawing right away.</p>

  to quickly create a drawing using supportive constructions and the ability of
  a CAD system to change existing entities.</p>
<a name="Co-ordinate Systems"></a>
<a name="3_6"></a><h2>Co-ordinate Systems</h2>

<p>
A good understanding of how co-ordinates work is absolutely crucial if
  you are to make the best use of any CAD program. If you're not familiar with
  co-ordinates it's highly recommended that you take some time to familiarize
  yourself with the basic concepts.</p>
<a name="Origin"></a>
<a name="Zero"></a>
<a name="Relative zero"></a>
<a name="3_6_1"></a><h3>Origin</h3>

<p>
The origin of the drawing is the point where the X and Y axis cross
  each other. It's the absolute zero of the drawing. In addition to the origin
  there's a relative zero point in QCad. This is a helpful spot that changes
  it's position depending on the current user interactions. The relative zero
  point can also be moved around by the user.</p>
<a name="Cartesian Co-ordinates"></a>
<a name="X-Ordinate"></a>
<a name="Y-Ordinate"></a>
<a name="3_6_2"></a><h3>Cartesian Co-ordinates</h3>

<p>
<i>(named after the French philosopher Ren&eacute; Descartes
  1596-1650)</i></p>
<p>
The Cartesian co-ordinate system is the standard co-ordinate system
  where the position of a point can be described by its distance from two axes,
  X and Y. Cartesian co-ordinates in QCad are written in the format:</p>
<p class="code">
x-ordinate,y-ordinate</p>
<p>

  where x-ordinate can be a number such as <code>2.5</code> or a mathematical
  expression like <code>cos(30)/2</code> (see 
  <a href="expressions.html">Mathematical Expressions</a>).
  </p>
<p class="figure">
<img border="0" src="imgs/co-ordinate01.png"></p><p class="figure_label">
<b>Figure 4:&nbsp;</b>Absolute
  Cartesian Co-ordinates 
  <code>40,30</code>

  .</p>
<p>
Cartesian co-ordinates can also originate in a position different from
  the origin. In that case we talk about 'relative co-ordinates'. In QCad,
  relative Cartesian co-ordinates are written in the format:</p>
<p class="code">
@x-ordinate,y-ordinate</p>
<p class="figure">
<img border="0" src="imgs/co-ordinate02.png"></p><p class="figure_label">
<b>Figure 5:&nbsp;</b>Relative
  Cartesian Co-ordinates @ 
  <code>30,10</code>

  .</p>
<a name="Polar Co-ordinates"></a>
<a name="Angle"></a>
<a name="3_6_3"></a><h3>Polar Co-ordinates</h3>

<p>
Polar co-ordinates use a distance and an angle to describe the position
  of a point. In QCad, polar co-ordinates are noted in the format:</p>
<p class="code">
distance&lt;angle</p>
<p class="figure">
<img border="0" src="imgs/co-ordinate03.png"></p><p class="figure_label">
<b>Figure 6:&nbsp;</b>Absolute
  Polar Co-ordinates 
  <code>50&lt;37</code>

  .</p>
<p>
Just like Cartesian co-ordinates, polar co-ordinates can also originate
  in a position different from the origin. In QCad, relative polar co-ordinates
  are written in the format:</p>
<p class="code">
@distance&lt;angle</p>
<p class="figure">
<img border="0" src="imgs/co-ordinate04.png"></p><p class="figure_label">
<b>Figure 7:&nbsp;</b>Relative
  Polar Co-ordinates 
  <code>@31.6&lt;18.4</code>

<a name="Object Snapping"></a>
<a name="Grid Snapping"></a>
<a name="Snapping"></a>
<a name="3_7"></a><h2>Object and Grid Snapping</h2>

<p>
Whenever you need to specify a co-ordinate in QCad, you can use the
  snap feature which allows you to precisely select grid points or significant
  points on existing objects: endpoints or midpoints of lines, etc.</p>
<p>
The chapter 
  <a href="snapping.html">"Object Snap"</a>

  gives you an overview over all snap tools.</p>
<a name="Transform"></a>
<a name="Duplicate"></a>
<a name="Select Objects"></a>
<a name="3_8"></a><h2>Basic Editing</h2>

<p>
Entities can be inserted, selected, and, once selected, can be deleted,
  transformed or duplicated. To insert an entity means to draw it by selecting
  the appropriate drawing tool, such as line, arc, etc., and by locating points
  that define the object to be drawn, such as the endpoints of a line.</p>
<p>
The chapter 
  <a href="construction.html">"Entity Drawing Commands"</a>

  lists all tools for adding new entities to a drawing.</p>
<a name="Select Entities"></a>
<a name="Entity Selection"></a>
<a name="3_8_1"></a><h3>Entity Selection</h3>

<p>
An entity must be selected before it can be deleted, duplicated, or
  transformed. Entity selection is one of the most basic of CAD operations.
  QCad offers a wide variety of selection tools to quickly select groups of
  entities, entities within a range, connected entities, etc.</p>
<p>
The chapter 
  <a href="selection.html">"Entity Selection"</a>

  introduces you into the selection tools of QCad.</p>
<a name="Deletion"></a>
<a name="Delete Entities"></a>
<a name="3_8_2"></a><h3>Deletion</h3>

<p>
Deleting an entity means to remove it from the drawing.</p>
<a name="Modifications"></a>
<a name="Transformations"></a>
<a name="3_8_3"></a><h3>Modifications</h3>

<p>
Basic modifications of a CAD systems include translation, rotation,
  reflection, and scaling. As well as these operations which don't alter the
  characteristic geometry of selected entities, there are some that do. You can
  break, trim, extend or stretch existing entities.</p>
<p>
The chapter 
  <a href="modification.html">"Modification"</a>

  lists and describes all tools for modifying and deleting entities.</p>
<a name="Viewing"></a>
<a name="Drawing scale"></a>
<a name="Sheet size"></a>
<a name="3_9"></a><h2>Viewing in CAD</h2>

<p>
Unlike in manual drafting, there is no need in CAD to determine in
  advance the sheet size and drawing scale. There is 
  <b>no</b>

  drawing scale: all sizes and distances are specified using their full-scale
  values. A 10 meter object is drawn as a 10 meter object. Only at the printing
  stage, the drawing scale needs to be determined based on sheet size and
  drawing size.</p>
<p>
On the screen, the user can adjust the currently visible area of the
  drawing by zooming in to view more detail or zooming out to view a wider
  extent. Another important viewing operation in CAD is panning. To see another
  portion of the drawing without changing the display scale, a user pans to it
  by "moving" a rectangular display window until it's over the desired
  spot.</p>
<a name="Visible area"></a>
<a name="Zooming"></a>
<a name="Display"></a>
<p>
Chapter 
  <a href="view.html">"Viewing"</a>

  is all about zooming and viewing functions.</p>
