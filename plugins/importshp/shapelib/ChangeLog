	* dbfopen.c/shapefil.h/safileio.c: read the Code Page information 
	from the DBF file, and exports this information as a string through 
	the DBFGetCodePage function.  This is either the number from the LDID
	header field ("LDID/<number>") or as the content of an accompanying 
	.CPG file.	When creating a DBF file, the code can be set using 
	DBFCreateEx.

2007-12-12  Bram de Greve <bram.degreve@bramz.net>

	* dbfopen.c: Made static field buffer in DBFReadAttribute() into a
	field in the DBFInfo structure to avoid multi-threading problems.
