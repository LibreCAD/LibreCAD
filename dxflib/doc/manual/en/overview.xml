  dxflib is a C++ library for reading and writing DXF files.
  When reading DXF files, dxflib parses the file and calls functions 
  that you define in your own C++ class for adding entities, 
  layers, ..

  <para>
  Please note that dxflib does not store any entities or other 
  information for you. It only passes the supported entities and
  other objects found in the DXF file to your C++ class.

  Using dxflib to read DXF files doesn't require any knowlege of
  the DXF format. However, it's still an advantage to know the
  basics about entities, attributes, layers and blocks. To write
  DXF files with dxflib you definitely need an idea of how a
  DXF file is organized.

  dxflib does not depend on any exotic other libraries, just the 
  standard C / C++ libraries.
