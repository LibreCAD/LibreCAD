  <img src="img/dxflib.png" ref="dxflib01" width="80">dxflib parses DXF files
  and calls functions in your class. In those functions you can for example add
  the entities to a vector or list of entities.</img>

  <subsection>Implementing the Creation Interface</subsection>

  <para>Your C++ class that handles DXF entities has to be derived from
  DL_CreationInterface or DL_CreationAdapter. In most cases DL_CreationAdapter
  is more convenient because it doesn't force you to implement all
  functions.</para>

  <includecode src="code/mydxffilter.h" />

  <para>The implementation of the functions in your class will typically add
  the entities to a container of entities or use the information in another
  way.</para>

  <includecode src="code/addline.cpp" />

  <newpage />

  <para>When reading a DXF file you simply pass on a reference to an object of
  your class to the parser.</para>
